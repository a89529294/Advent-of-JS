# Verification Code Form

## TODO

1. Implement copy & paste functionality.

## What I learned

1. Using the clipboard API
2. Practice using useReducer
3. For events like keyDown, there are special properties 'ctrlKey','shiftKey', and 'metaKey' to tell you whether the user used 'ctrl + v' or 'cmd + v', etc.
