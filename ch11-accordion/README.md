# Accordion CH 11 Advent of JS

## WHat I Have Learned

1. Learned about `transform-style:preserve-3d;` on parent elements and `transform:translateZ(-10px)` on child elements to move child elements behind parent elements.
2. `isolation:isolate` on parent element will make `transform-style:preserve-3d;` invalid.
