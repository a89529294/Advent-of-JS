# What I Learned

1. use getBoundingClientRect() on an element to detect if element is out of viewport.
2. element.scrollIntoView() to bring element back into view.
3. Finally understood the hiearchy between [Element, HTMLElement, and HTMLDivElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLDivElement)
